Children's Privacy Policy <br/>

The following paragraphs relate to TEF's policy regarding the collection and use of personal information about children.<br/>

Types of personal information collected: Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), "personal information" is defined as individually identifiable information, such as a first and last name; a home or other physical address, including street name and city or town; an e-mail address; a telephone number; a Social Security number; or persistent identifiers such as customer or processor serial numbers held in a cookie, where the identifier is associated with individually identifiable information. TEF usually does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA. We collect and use only as much information about a child as necessary for the activity, and do not condition participation in any online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary. Occasionally, we use cookies to store pertinent User information during a session.<br/>

Use of personal information: We use the information we collect from children only for internal business purposes, for the child to participate on the Website, and/or to give credit to children for work they have created. We contact children by e-mail only in response to their requests for information or assistance. TEF uses cookies solely for the purpose of holding information during online sessions.  If, however, a child voluntarily discloses personal information, such as a name or e-mail address, on bulletin boards or in chat areas that are accessible to other Users, then such information could be collected and disclosed by others. TEF cannot take any responsibility for such collection or disclosure.<br/>

Involvement of parents: In accordance with the provisions of COPPA, we will notify parents when collecting personal information from children, and will seek parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing certain personal information from children. Parents may review and have deleted their child's personal information, and may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by contacting the TEF representatives listed herein. Parents may consent to our collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to others.<br/>
