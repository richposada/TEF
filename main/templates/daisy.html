		The EVAN Foundation would like to thank Daisy Troop 2337 from Spark Matsunaga Elementary School in Germantown, MD for their generous donation of Girl Scout Cookies and a variety of toys for our Treats and Treasures Carts at Childrenâ€™s National Medical Center in Washington, DC.  The kids enjoyed taking their pick of a toy and a box of cookies.  Thank you, Daisies!
