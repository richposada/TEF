<h2>Neuroblastoma</h2>
<h3>What Is Neuroblastoma?</h3>
<div id='content_text'><p>Neuroblastoma is one of the most complex and devastating of all pediatric cancers. It is a
tumor of the sympathetic nervous system that quickly spreads throughout the entire body. It
is a cowardly disease that primarily strikes young children before the age of 5. Neuroblastoma
is extremely rare, with approximately 700 new cases a year seen in the U.S. Less that 30% of
children diagnosed with high-risk disease survive.</p><p>
Those fortunate enough to survive face a lifetime of treatment-related physical and emotional
challenges, including the likelihood of developing a secondary malignancy. Only one hurdle
stands between the unacceptable status quo and better treatments and a cure for this awful
disease -- support for research.</p>

<h3>A Few Facts To Consider...</h3>
<div id='content_text'>
<ul>
<li>There are no FDA approved drugs for neuroblastoma. There has only been one drug
approved by the FDA for ANY pediatric cancer in the last 20 years.</li><br>
<li>The National Cancer Institute allocates $200 million out of its annual $5.1 billion budget
to pediatric cancer research. That is just 4%, despite the fact that pediatric cancer is
the number one disease killer of children in the U.S. The amount specifically dedicated
to neuroblastoma is so low that it is not even made publicly available by NCI.</li><br>
<li>There is virtually no private pharmaceutical investment in neuroblastoma research due
to a lack of market incentives.</li><br>
<li>The American Cancer Society dedicates less that 1% of its $1 billion in annual public
revenues to pediatric cancer research. No figure is publicly available for neuroblastoma.</li>
</ul>
