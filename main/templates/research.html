<h2>EVAN FOUNDATION SUPPORT FOR NEUROBLASTOMA RESEARCH</h2>
<div id='content_text'>
	The EVAN Foundation is very proud to support the following neuroblastoma research projects aimed at improving the lives of young children in treatment.  These promising initiatives have been undertaken by leading neuroblastoma investigators committed to fostering more effective treatments and a cure for this devastating pediatric cancer.  Total funding from the Foundation for these awards is $80,000. We thank our supporters for making it possible!

<h3>CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATEMENT OF NEUROBLASTOMA</h3>
<div id='content_text'>
	<ul>
	<li><p>$30,000 for Dr. Barry Maurer and Dr. Pat Reynolds at the Texas Tech University Health Science Center.  This award was made in April of 2013 to support  the formulation of the anti-neuroblastoma drug fenretinide into an oral powder that is easier for children to take and better absorbed by the body.   The oral powder form of fenretinide has been shown to increase active levels of the drug in the body by 4 to 6 times compared to the capsule form.  In  clinical use to date, oral powder fenretinide has produced several long-term complete responses in neuroblastoma patients with minimal disease.  The Fenretinide/Lym-X-Sorb Oral Powder manufactured through the EVAN Foundation grant will be combined with the drugs ketoconazole and vincristine in a  Phase I clinical trial treating  relapsed neuroblastoma patients in the West Texas South Plains Oncology Consortium.  Approximately 18-24 patients will be enrolled in the trial which is expected to start in late 2013.  The pediatric centers within the West Texas consortium include; Cook's Children's Hospital, Ft. Worth, TX, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX, MD Anderson, Houston, TX, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK.  Results from the trial will be brought to the national Children's Oncology Group for further development and clinical trial consideration.</p></li>

		<p>$10,000 to Dr. Giselle Sholler at the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids, MI.  The funds are being used to support a clinical through the Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium. The NMTRC is comprised of 18 universities and children’s hospitals across the United States treating children with late-stage neuroblastoma. Dr. Sholler serves as chair of the consortium.  The EVAN Foundation funds helped launch a Phase II clinical trial looking at the potential for Difluoromethylornithine or “DFMO” to prevent a re-occurrence of neuroblastoma that is in remission.   This is the only neuroblastoma clinical trial that allows children in first remission - and at high-risk for relapse - to enroll.  64 patients are expected to participate in this promising study that began in June of 2012. The EVAN Foundation grant was provided in May of 2012.</p>

<h3>TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH ON NEUROBLASTOMA AT CHOP</h3>
<div id='content_text'>
	<ul>
	<li>$20,000 to Dr. Yael Mossé, Director of the Neuroblastoma Therapeutics Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, for her “Molecular Oncology for Pediatric Cancers:  Neuroblastoma as a Model” project.  Dr. Mossé is a leading neuroblastoma clinician and investigator who is using our funds to speed the translation of molecular discoveries made in her laboratory into new treatments for young patients.   Dr. Mosse and her team are specifically focusing on the translational development of four drugs that target different growth pathways in neuroblastoma. These pathways include ALK, CHK1, CDK2 and 4, MEK, mTOR, PI3K.  In addition, she is developing a responder hypothesis for each drug to inform the design of clinical trials to treat patients. This grant was provided in October of 2012.</li>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL NEUROBLASTOMA RESEARCH COLLABORATION</h3>
<div id='content_text'>
	<ul>
	<li>$20,000 for an international research collaboration aimed at standardizing the analysis and reporting of tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.  Bone marrow involvement is a critical factor in determining what treatment a child should receive. The analysis of bone marrow tests however, varies across institutions and countries.  The funds from the Foundation are supporting the work of three researchers; one in the U.S., one in the UK, and one in the Netherlands.  They are reviewing bone marrow samples from all three countries and assess best practices for determining the presence of tumor cells and levels of biomarkers that predict poor outcomes.  This will aid in the standardization of bone marrow reporting, inform the development of superior methods of marrow disease monitoring, and help children get placed into the proper treatment protocol.  This research was born out of a meeting of neuroblastoma experts convened by the National Cancer Institute in 2012 to revise the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria. The funding was provided to Dr. Julie Park at Seattle Children's Hospital in January of 2013.  Dr. Park chairs the Children's Oncology Group's Neuroblastoma Committee, co-chairs the effort to revise the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria, and oversees the research funded by the Foundation.</li>
