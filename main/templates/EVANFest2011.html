				EVANFest A BIG SUCCESS!

				<p>On September 17th, The Evan's Victory Against Neuroblastoma Foundation hosted its kick-off event - EVANfest - in 			 Gaithersburg, MD.  More than 300 people braved the chilly, rainy weather to remember Evan and support the Foundation!   Kids and adults enjoyed an afternoon of games, races, moon bounces, face painting, hair design, live entertainment, food and a popular raffle for an IPad2.</p> 
				<p>In a remarkable show of support, over $12,000 was raised for our fight against neuroblastoma!  We are truly humbled by the success of this first event.  100% of the funds will go to neuroblastoma research and patient wellness programs aimed at young children currently in treatment.</p>
